# Project 02: Digit Recognition Using the MNIST Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9) and their corresponding labels. Participants will preprocess the data, build a neural network model, train the model, and evaluate its accuracy. This project offers a hands-on approach to understanding image classification using deep learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess the **MNIST dataset**.
- Build a neural network model to classify handwritten digits.
- Train the model and visualize training progress with loss/accuracy curves.
- Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- Experiment with model architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Dataset Details
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of:
- **Training set**: 60,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
- **Test set**: 10,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.

Each image corresponds to a single digit (0–9) with an associated label.

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the MNIST dataset using libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Apply preprocessing steps like normalization to scale pixel values.
- Visualize a sample of the images along with their labels to understand the dataset.

### 2. Building the Neural Network Model
- Design a feedforward neural network with:
  - Input layer to process flattened 28x28 images.
  - Hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU.
  - Output layer with 10 units for each digit class.
- Use a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement the model.

### 3. Defining the Loss and Optimizer
- Use CrossEntropyLoss (or equivalent) for the classification task.
- Choose an optimizer like Adam or SGD to update model weights during training.

### 4. Training the Model
- Train the model over several epochs, iterating through the training dataset.
- Track the training loss to monitor progress.
- Validate the model on the test dataset to measure its generalization.

### 5. Visualizing Loss and Accuracy
- Plot training and validation loss curves to observe convergence.
- Include accuracy metrics to evaluate the model’s performance over time.

### 6. Evaluating the Model
- Test the trained model on unseen data and calculate metrics such as accuracy.
- Visualize a set of predictions alongside true labels to analyze performance.

### 7. Experimentation
Explore different ways to improve model performance:
- Modify the architecture by adding more layers or neurons.
- Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers.
- Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for better feature extraction.
- Use data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, or flipping.

## Deliverables
1. **Code**: Python scripts for training and evaluating the digit recognition model.
2. **Visualizations**: Graphs showing loss curves and sample predictions.
3. **Report**: A 2-page report detailing the model’s performance and improvements against the experiment parameters.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain experience with preprocessing image datasets.
- Build and train neural network models for classification tasks.
- Learn how to analyze model performance and optimize neural networks.
- Develop problem-solving skills by experimenting with different techniques.
