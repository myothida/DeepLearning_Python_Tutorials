    "### **Transfer Learning: Fine-Tuning Parameters**\n",
    "Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning where you take a pre-trained model and adapt it for a new task. The pre-trained model is usually trained on a large benchmark dataset (like ImageNet), which allows it to learn general features that can be useful for a wide range of tasks. Fine-tuning is one of the approaches to leveraging pre-trained models for a new problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical pre-trained model, there are two main parts:\n",
    "- **Feature extraction layers**: These are usually convolutional layers that are used to detect important features like edges, textures, and patterns in images. These features are often general and transferable across different tasks.\n",
    "- **Classifier layers**: These are usually fully connected layers that take the extracted features and make predictions based on them. These layers are specific to the dataset on which the model was trained (e.g., ImageNet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning involves making adjustments to the entire pre-trained model or part of it to adapt it to a new dataset, rather than starting from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load a Pre-Trained Model**: In PyTorch, pre-trained models from TorchVision are readily available. You can use models like ResNet, VGG, and others that have been trained on large datasets like ImageNet.\n",
    "2. **Replace the Classifier Layers**: Since the original model is trained on a different dataset (e.g., ImageNet), we need to replace its classifier layers to match the number of classes in our new dataset.\n",
    "3. **Freeze the Pre-Trained Layers (Optional)**: In fine-tuning, you can choose to freeze the weights of the pre-trained (feature extraction) layers and only update the classifier layer. Freezing layers means preventing their weights from being updated during training, which can help when you have limited data.\n",
    "4. **Define the Loss Function and Optimizer**: Now, we need to set up the loss function and optimizer for training. The loss function depends on the type of task you are performing (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss for classification), and the optimizer will update the weights during training.\n",
    "5. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Finally, we can train the model. During training, the pre-trained layers (if not frozen) will also be updated based on the new task. You can train for a few epochs to fine-tune the model.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the Model**: After training, it's important to evaluate the model on unseen data to check its performance.\n",
