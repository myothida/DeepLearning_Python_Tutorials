# Introduction to Deep Learning Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials and resources for the course **Introduction to Deep Learning**, providing a practical and hands-on approach to learning. The course focuses on the fundamentals of neural networks, including:  

- **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  

Students will explore these concepts in depth and learn how to implement them effectively using Python and popular libraries such as **Keras** and **PyTorch**.
