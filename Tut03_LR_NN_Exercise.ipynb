    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Model**: Create a simple neural network class using PyTorch with one hidden layer consisting of 2 neurons. Use the following architecture:\n",
    "   - **Input Layer**: 3 neurons (one for each input feature: Engine size, Car weight, Number of cylinders)\n",
    "   - **Hidden Layer**: 2 neurons\n",
    "   - **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (predicted fuel efficiency)\n",

    "#### Activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is an Activation Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "An activation function is a mathematical function applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network. It helps decide whether a neuron should be activated or not, based on the input. Without activation functions, the neural network would only be able to perform linear transformations, which limits its ability to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Role of Activation Functions:\n",
    "1. **Introduce Non-Linearity**: Most real-world data are non-linear. Activation functions help neural networks learn non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "2. **Determine Output**: The activation function determines the output of each neuron in the network based on the input received.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Types of Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Sigmoid Activation Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sigmoid** activation function squashes input values into the range (0, 1). It is often used in binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula**:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Properties**:\n",
    "- Outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- It is used in the output layer of binary classifiers.\n",
    "- The sigmoid function is **differentiable**, which allows the model to be trained via backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If $ x = 2 $, then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(2) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-2}} \\approx 0.88\n",

    "##### 2. **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) Activation Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tanh** (hyperbolic tangent) function is similar to the sigmoid but scales the output to the range (-1, 1). It is generally preferred over the sigmoid when working with hidden layers.\n",

    "**Properties**:\n",
    "- Outputs values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "- The tanh function is **differentiable** and is used when we need outputs that can be both positive and negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If $ x = 1 $, then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tanh(1) = \\frac{e^1 - e^{-1}}{e^1 + e^{-1}} \\approx 0.76\n",

    "##### 3. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ReLU** activation function is one of the most commonly used activation functions in modern neural networks. It outputs the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it outputs zero.\n",
